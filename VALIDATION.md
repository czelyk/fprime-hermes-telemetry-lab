# Packaging validation — 22 October 2026

**Executed successfully in the curated working copy:** 4 Go unit tests (including vet), replay of 40 captured host frames, 73 exact packets / 766 matching channel measurements / an exact 8,192-byte file; both accidental-corruption cases passed.

Actual prior F Prime host capture replayed through native Go/Hermes and native Python/GDS imports. It is not new flight data, an MCU/RF test, full UI testing, or evidence of research superiority. Docker startup failed locally, so the new packaged sender-build/capture route was not rerun; native replay requires no Docker.

Raw fresh outputs are retained in `evidence/packaging-20261022/`; earlier evidence
remains in `evidence/recorded/`. The `verification.json` file records the actual
test working directory and the file count at execution time. Later additions of
documentation/evidence change the final package file count, not those results.

Environment: Windows, Python 3.12.10; applicable tools were Arm GNU 15.2.1,
Unicorn 2.1.4, pyelftools 0.32, Renode 1.17.0, OpenJDK 21.0.10 and Go 1.27.3.
Only tools actually used by this project are prerequisites; see README.md.

Historical reports retain their original scope, decisions and local source paths.
Use the current README for execution. Historical paths are provenance, not runtime
dependencies. The clean Git copy and ZIP are checked again with `--verify-only`.
No physical testing, new scientific GO, conference acceptance or publication is
claimed by this packaging operation.
